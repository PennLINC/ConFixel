This is a toy voxel-wise dataset for testing ConVoxel.
* It was generated using scripts in [ModelArray_tests](https://github.com/PennLINC/ModelArray_tests) GitHub repository.
  * Using scripts in folder `testdata_ConFixel` there.
* It includes n=20 voxel-wise data with individual masks and a group mask.
  * Each voxel-wise image has random values in a center ball, and may or may not have values around this ball, making individual masks different among all subjects.
  * The values are between 0-1.
  * [The group mask](group_mask_FA.nii.gz) covers all possible voxels which could have positive values (i.e., a bigger ball).
  * (Not necessary, only used for checking purpose) [A mask of core](core_mask_FA.nii.gz) defines voxels that all subjects have.
* All the individual images were generated by random but with a fixed seed in Python. They were generated on a Mac M1 Pro with MacOS version Monterey (12.6).
